        <h2>Gameplay Features</h2>

        <h3>What are the 4 rounds?</h3>
        <p>The app tracks scores for 4 distinct rounds:</p>

        </ol>

        <h3>How do I enter scores?</h3>
        <p>Each round uses custom dial controls for score input. Simply rotate the dial to set each player's score for that round. Scores are automatically saved as you adjust them.</p>

        <h3>Can I go back to previous rounds?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use the back button to return to previous rounds and modify scores if needed.</p>

        <h3>How does the app determine the winner?</h3>
        <p>The app automatically calculates total scores by adding all 4 rounds for each player. The player with the highest total score is declared the winner.</p>

        <h2>Player Management</h2>

        <h3>How do I add a new player?</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to the Player Setup screen</li>

        <h3>What happens if I try to add a duplicate name?</h3>
        <p>The app prevents duplicate player names. You'll receive an error message if you try to add a player with a name that already exists.</p>

        <h3>How do I remove a player from the current game?</h3>
        <p>Tap the X button on their name chip in the "CHOSEN ONES" section, or unselect them from the main player list.</p>

        <h2>Leaderboard & Statistics</h2>

        <h3>Does the app track wins?</h3>
        <p>Yes, the app tracks total wins for each player using Core Data. You can view the leaderboard from the welcome screen.</p>

        <h3>How do I view the leaderboard?</h3>
        <p>From the welcome screen, tap "VIEW LEADERBOARD" to see player statistics and win counts.</p>

        <h3>Are game results automatically saved?</h3>
        <p>Player win counts are updated automatically when a game is completed.</p>

        <h2>Technical Issues</h2>

        <h3>The app isn't working properly. What should I do?</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Try force-closing and reopening the app</li>
          <li>Restart your device</li>
          <li>Make sure you have the latest version installed</li>
          <li>If problems persist, you may need to reinstall the app</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>I lost my player data. Can I recover it?</h3>
        <p>Player data is stored locally using Core Data. If the app data is deleted or corrupted, unfortunately the player list and win statistics cannot be recovered.</p>

        <h3>Does the app work offline?</h3>
        <p>Yes, DoomScore works completely offline. No internet connection is required.</p>

        <h2>Game Rules & Scoring</h2>

        <h3>Does the app enforce Doomlings rules?</h3>
        <p>No, the app is purely a score tracker. It doesn't enforce any specific game rules or validate scores - you can enter any score values.</p>

        <h3>Can I use this for different versions of Doomlings?</h3>
        <p>Yes, since the app doesn't enforce specific rules, you can use it to track scores for different versions or house rules of Doomlings.</p>

        <h3>What if we play with different rounds?</h3>
        <p>While the app is designed for the standard 4-round Doomlings format, you can adapt it by skipping rounds or entering 0 for unused rounds.</p>

        <h2>App Features</h2>

        <h3>Can I customize the themes or colors?</h3>
        <p>The app uses a fixed "Doom" theme with colors inspired by creature artwork (browns, dark blues, golden accents). Theme customization is not currently available.</p>

        <h3>Does the app have sound effects?</h3>
        <p>No, the current version focuses on clean, visual scoring without audio elements.</p>

        <h3>Can I export game results?</h3>
        <p>Currently, the app doesn't support exporting game data or results to external files.</p>

        <h2>Tips & Best Practices</h2>

        <h3>Any tips for faster score entry?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Pre-add your regular gaming group to the player list</li>
          <li>Use the dial controls efficiently by dragging to quickly reach approximate scores, then fine-tune</li>
          <li>Take advantage of the ability to go back and modify previous round scores if needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How should I handle ties?</h3>
        <p>The app will show the first player in the list as the winner in case of ties. You can implement your own tie-breaking rules outside the app.</p>

        <h3>Can I use this for tournaments?</h3>
        <p>While possible, the app is designed for individual game sessions. For tournaments, you'd need to manually track results from multiple games.</p>
